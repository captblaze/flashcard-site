<h2 class="text-center">JavaScript Variables</h2>
<p>Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.</p>
<p> Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization. You can do variable initialization at the time of variable creation or at a later point in time when you need that variable.</p>

<p> Note âˆ’ Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization, once for the life of any variable name in a document. You should not re-declare same variable twice.</p>

  <p>  JavaScript is untyped language. This means that a JavaScript variable can hold a value of any data type. Unlike many other languages, you don't have to tell JavaScript during variable declaration what type of value the variable will hold. The value type of a variable can change during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.</p>
