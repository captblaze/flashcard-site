<h1 > What is an Operator?</h1>

<p> us take a simple expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator. JavaScript supports the following types of operators.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Comparison Operators</li>
<li>Logical (or Relational) Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Conditional (or ternary) Operators</li>
<ul>
<p>Lets have a look on all operators one by one.</p>
<h1>Arithmetic Operators</h1>
<p>JavaScript supports the following arithmetic operators −</p>

<p>Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −</p>
<table style="width: 50%;" >
    <tr>
        <th> Sr.No.	</th>
        <th> Operator & Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> 1</td>
        <td> 	
            + (Addition)  <br> 
             Adds two operands  <br> 
             Ex: A + B will give 30</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
    <td>2 </td>
    <td>- (Subtraction)  <br> 
        Subtracts the second operand from the first  <br> 
        Ex: A - B will give -10 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> 3</td>
    <td> * (Multiplication)  <br> 
        Multiply both operands   <br>      
        Ex: A * B will give 200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>4 </td>
    <td> / (Division)  <br> 
        Divide the numerator by the denominator  <br>        
        Ex: B / A will give 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> 5</td>
    <td> % (Modulus)  <br> 
       Outputs the remainder of an integer division    <br>    
        Ex: B % A will give 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> 6</td>
    <td>++ (Increment)  <br> 
        Increases an integer value by one    <br>       
        Ex: A++ will give 11 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>7 </td>
    <td> -- (Decrement)  <br> 
        Decreases an integer value by one   <br>   
        Ex: A-- will give 9</td>
</tr>
</table><br>

<h1>Comparison Operators</h1>
<p>JavaScript supports the following comparison operators −</p>

<p>Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −</p>

<table style="width: 50%;" >
    <tr>
        <th> Sr.No.	</th>
        <th> Operator & Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> 1</td>
        <td>      = = (Equal)<br>
Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true.<br>
Ex: (A == B) is not true.</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
    <td>2 </td>
    <td>!= (Not Equal)<br>
        Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.     <br> 
        Ex: (A != B) is true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> 3</td>
    <td>> (Greater than)<br>
        Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.<br>
           Ex: (A > B) is not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>4 </td>
    <td> < (Less than)<br>
        Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. <br>  
        Ex: (A < B) is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> 5</td>
    <td>>= (Greater than or Equal to)<br>
        Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. <br>
        Ex: (A >= B) is not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> 6</td>
    <td><= (Less than or Equal to)<br>
        Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. <br>
        Ex: (A <= B) is true. </td>
</tr>
